**HaarCascade**

Haar - Name of the person who developed the algo
Cascade - Something arranged or occurring in a series or in a succession of stages so that each stage derives from or acts upon the product of the preceding

When an image is passed,it goes through the xml file comparing the passed image with each trained face until it finds a trained face which is close enough with the passed image and declares it as a face and passes the coordinates 

**Haar features**
1) Edge feature
2) Line feature
3) Four rectangle feature

**How haar cascade works**
REFER **haar.png** 
The black region of the box is for darker part of image and light part is for ligher part
This is why we use a grayscaled image because we need dark and light parts of the image

A lot of these features are applied on the image before declaring it as a face.

**How to train an algorithm**
Two Types of images are fed to the algo
1) Faces
2) Non faces

The algo chains all the haar features that matches and add them together until we get a face template
If a non face image is passed the unsuccessfull haar features are matched and declares it as a non face

We have to try every haar feature on every training image,every type,every size,every location
Each haar face gives us a number true or false
Which ever haar feature matches the training image closest is our winner
